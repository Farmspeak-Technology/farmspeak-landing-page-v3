            <p class="text-lg">Online trainings are Free and occur every-week (except on holidays), check the schedule by clicking on a training link above.<br><br>

            In the group workshops, you'll learn more about farm record-keeping and FarmSpeak through an online training workshop. After registering youâ€™ll receive an email with a link to join the workshop. When it's time for your session, you'll be able to access the video training session right from your computer, tablet or smart phone.<br><br>

            In addition to learning more about FarmSpeak, you'll also have an opportunity to ask questions (via chat or at a closing Q&A) as well as listen to other participants questions. When you join the session you'll be automatically muted, so don't worry about background noise.<br><br>

            If you have additional questions after the training, don't worry, you can always schedule an individual consultation to discuss the specifics of your operation. Also, if you miss your session or want to attend again, feel free to join as many sessions as you want.<br><br>

            Looking forward to seeing you!
